# Guitar-Learner

## Description

This is a Python application for practicing different elements of playing guitar like quick chord swapping and learning strumming patterns.<br>
I wanted to build this to help myself learn guitar.

## Installation

### Libraries
You will need to install:
- pygame

### Running the application
After downloading the repository and installing the libraries required, run main.py.<br>
Then, you can choose to play either the Chord Game or the Strum Pattern Game from the main menu.

#### Chord Game
This game will show a chord and your job is to play the shown chord in time with the metronome.

#### Strum Pattern Game
This game will show a strumming pattern and your job is to adjust your current strumming pattern to it, playing the pattern in time with the metronome.
